Sticky Selection
================

[IntelliJ Idea plugin](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7341) similar to the Notepad++ feature, where you can "paint selection": you can permanently highlight any selection with one of 8 different background colors. All other occurrences of the identical text of that selection in the same file are highlighted automatically.
